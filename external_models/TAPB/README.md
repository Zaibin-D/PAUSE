# TAPB: An Interventional Debiasing Framework for Alleviating Target Prior Bias in Drug-Target Interaction Prediction🚀

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of **TAPB**, which aims to alleviate target prior bias in DTI prediction.

## Framework👀

## System Requirements👍

The source code was developed in Python 3.9 using PyTorch 2.2.1. The required Python dependencies are given below. TAPB is supported for any standard computer and operating system (Windows/macOS/Linux) with enough RAM to run. There are no additional non-standard hardware requirements.

```
torch=2.2.1
numpy=1.23.0
scikit-learn=1.2.1
pandas=2.2.3
prettytable>=2.2.1
rdkit~=2024.3.3
transformers=4.38.2
tqdm~=4.66.2
pandas~=2.2.3
matplotlib=3.5.0
omegaconf=2.3.0
```

## Datasets🐴

The `datasets` folder contains all experimental data used in TAPB: [BindingDB](https://github.com/peizhenbai/DrugBAN), [BioSNAP](https://github.com/peizhenbai/DrugBAN), [Davis](https://github.com/samsledje/ConPLex\_dev), [Human](https://github.com/peizhenbai/DrugBAN).

## Run TAPB on Our Data to Reproduce Results🏃

To train TAPB, we provide the basic configurations for hyperparameters in `model_config.yaml` and `train_config.yaml`.

💡For that we use Molformer's tokenizer to tokenize SMILES and ESM-2 to extract target features. Please download the weights and related files and put them into `./models/drug/molformer` and `./protein/esm2_model`, separately.  

To accelerate the training process and reduce GPU memory usage, we pre-extract and save the target features for each dataset using ESM-2.

Molformer can be downloaded from [Molformer Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ibm-research/MoLFormer-XL-both-10pct/tree/main). ESM-2 can be downloaded from [ESM-2 Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/facebook/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D). 

🔥Or, you can download both of the Molformer weights and the ESM-2 weights from our [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/c/764a5294625e5035/Emy3-AWnwdZJsvmuLQa2qzwBXwK2JPVdJRG4t0mwallyNA)

For the in-domain experiments, you can directly run the following command for interventional training. `${dataset}` could either be `bindingdb`, `biosnap`, or `davis`.

```
$ python main.py --data ${dataset} --split random
```

For the Human dataset, you can directly run the following command for interventional training.

```
$ python main.py --data Human --split cold
```

For the cross-domain experiments, you can directly run the following command for interventional training. `${dataset}` could be either `bindingdb`, `biosnap`.

```
$ python main.py --data ${dataset} --split cluster
```
